# smcli: Spacemesh Command-line Interface Tool

smcli is a simple command line tool that you can use to manage wallet files (in the future it may be expanded with
additional functionality).

It currently supports the following features. Note that this documentation is not intended to be as complete as the
built-in help documentation in the application itself, which fully documents all commands, flags, and features.
Run `smcli -h` to see this documentation.

## Wallet

smcli allows you to read encrypted wallet files (including those created using Smapp and other compatible tools), and
generate new wallet files.

### Reading

To read an encrypted wallet file, run:

```console
smcli wallet read <filename>
```

You'll be prompted to enter the (optional) password used to encrypt the wallet file. If you enter the correct password,
you'll see the contents of the wallet printed, including the accounts it contains. Include the flags `--full` to see
full keys, and `--private` to see private keys and mnemonic in addition to public keys.

Note that you can read both wallet files created using `smcli` as well as those created using
[Smapp](https://github.com/spacemeshos/smapp/) or any other tool that supports standard Spacemesh wallet format.

### Generation

To generate a new wallet, run:

```console
smcli wallet create
```

The command will prompt you to enter a
[BIP39-compatible mnemonic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), or alternatively generate
a new, random mnemonic for you. It will then prompt you to enter a password to encrypt the wallet file (optional but
highly recommended) and will then generate an encrypted wallet file with one or more new keypairs.

Note that these keypairs (public and private key) are _not_ the same as Spacemesh wallet addresses. The public key can
be converted directly and deterministically into your wallet address; in other words, there is a one-to-one mapping
between public keys and wallet addresses. Conversion and outputting of public keys as wallet addresses
[will be available shortly](https://github.com/spacemeshos/smcli/issues/38).

#### Hardware wallet support

`smcli` supports key generation using Ledger hardware devices including Nano S, Nano S+, and Nano X. To generate a
wallet file using a hardware wallet, first sideload the
[Spacemesh Ledger app](https://github.com/spacemeshos/app-spacemesh) onto your device (follow the instructions in that
README). Make sure the device is connected and unlocked and the Spacemesh app is open, then run:

```console
smcli wallet create --ledger
```

Note that the created wallet file will not contain any private keys or mnemonic (as these obviously remain on the
Ledger device). If you subsequently use `smcli wallet read` to read the file, these will not be printed. We still
recommend encrypting the wallet file with a secure password for privacy purposes.

**NOTE: We strongly recommend only creating a new wallet on a hardware wallet or on a secure, airgapped computer. You
are responsible for safely storing your mnemonic and wallet files. Your mnemonic is the ONLY way to restore access to
your wallet and accounts if you misplace the wallet file, so it's essential that you back it up securely and reliably.
There is absolutely nothing that we can do to help you recover your wallet if you misplace the file or mnemonic.**

## Genesis

smcli includes commands to verify the information contained in the genesis ledger.

### Verify

To verify the vesting (owner) address and vault address for a particular genesis vesting vault, run:

```console
smcli genesis verify
```

This command will prompt you to enter one or more public keys, along with the multisig params (minimum required signers)
and vaulted amount. It will subsequently output the vesting and vault addresses associated with the vault.

## Building

Building the app is fairly straightforward. The only prerequisites are Golang with CGO support, `libudev` on Linux
(`sudo apt-get install libudev-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu) and two libraries that will be statically linked into the binary.
All of the details are handled in `Makefile` and should work on Linux (AMD64 and ARM64), macOS (Intel and Apple
Silicon), and Windows. Simply run `make build`, which should download the correct libraries for your OS and platform.
See the [release CI workflow](https://github.com/spacemeshos/smcli/blob/develop/.github/workflows/release.yml) for more
details, and feel free to open an issue if you encounter any trouble.
